Hello!

This is simply a reminder to replace the following information if you want to deploy the project and test it:

- Replace the variable _uri with the localhost that is assigned upon deploying.
- Replace in Appsettings.json the connection string to one that follows the properties of the classes found in the project, specifically in Domain.

And that would be it. Have fun! I will be updating this project to add more functionality and classes the more I learn about the architecture that I'm using and trying to understand.
